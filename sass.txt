@@@ .*pumpkin spice
WTF is "pumpkin spice"?
Would you like cream on that? How about no.
It's not Autumn, this is not America and I am not a Starbucks.
I don't see any knee-high uggs or yoga pants, so no.
The spice must flow!

Cat got your tongue?
So... are you gonna order a coffee or not?
Yes?
You rang?
At your service.

That's not going to work.
Why do you even bother?
Nice try, but no cigar.
